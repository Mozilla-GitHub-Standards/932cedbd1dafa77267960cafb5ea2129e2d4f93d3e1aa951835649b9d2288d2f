Directory Conventions
    Naming
        Directory names should be undercase
        Hypens are preferable to dashes
            i.e. user-advocacy not user_advocacy
    Organization
        Projects
            Directories are organized by function then project
            The high-level directory tree is as follows:
                user-advocacy
                    fe - front-end code
                        css
                        doc
                        img
                        js
                        lib - shared front-end libraries
                    be - back-end code
                        data - data storage
                        lib - shared back-end libraries
                        pipelines - pipeline scripts
                        tools - ad hoc back-end tools
                    best-practices - an area to share our best practices for 
                            User Advocacy
        Testing
            Tests are preferred, but not required for low-risk scripts. If you 
                    submit code that will be reused or code that is complicated 
                    then tests will be required.
            Test files should be placed in a test subdirectory of the path of
                    the code that you are testing.
            Test files should follow the naming convention:
                    <file_to_be_tested>_test.<extention>
            e.g.
                Code: /dir/code.py
                Test: /dir/test/code_test.py

Code/Framework Preferences
    TODO(rrayborn): More thought here
    Scripting
        Moving forward we're encouraging Python due to it's commonality, 
        readability, and libraries, but we have used Perl historically
    Front-ends
        Historically we have written in Django or html/D3.js/MySQL
    Data Analysis
        Historically the team has used MySQL and Python
